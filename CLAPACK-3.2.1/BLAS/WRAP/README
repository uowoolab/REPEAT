f2c'd BLAS wrapper


The f2c translated BLAS interfaces used by CLAPACK (and other f2c'd codes)
unfortunately often don't quite match the Fortran interfaces on various 
platforms.  Consequently, it is difficult to use f2c'd codes with high
performance BLAS routines, which may substantially impede the performance
of these codes.  These simple wrappers provide a way around this difficulty
by providing f2c style interfaces (preceded with "f2c_" to avoid name
collisions) that call through to an underlying CBLAS or F77 BLAS. 


f2c.h:  The f2c header file

blaswrap.h:  A header file to be included in f2c codes that will use the
   wrapper.  Just #include it at the top of an f2c generated file.

cblaswr.c:  A wrapper around the CBLAS interface.  This interface is
   provided, for instance, by ATLAS (see www.netlib.org/atlas)

fblaswr.c:  A sample wrapper around a conventional Fortran BLAS interface.
   This works on a Sun platform, but will require substantial tinkering
   on platforms with different Fortran calling conventions.

cblas.h:  A header file for the CBLAS interface.

fblaswr.h:  A header file for the (Sun-style) Fortran BLAS interface

[cz]rotg.c:  Complex Givens rotation routines.  For some reason, C interfaces
   to these routines were not specified in the CBLAS interface.
