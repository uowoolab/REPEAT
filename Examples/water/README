In this directory files corresponding to a water molecule in a 
periodic box are provided. See the manual for specific details
related to each one of the files.

The file "charges_no_symm.out" includes the predictions for the charges
if all the atoms are considered as independent variables within the fit.

The file "charges_symm.out" corresponds to the predictions when the two
H atoms are forced to have the same charge. The "symmetry.input" was used
for this purpose.
