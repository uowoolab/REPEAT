Installation
============

+ Untar the source
+ Modify `Makefile` to the same compilation options as your SIESTA
+ `make siesta2repeat`

Running
=======

+ Run SIESTA calculation with `SaveElectrostaticPotential .true.` and an
  appropriate mesh
+ Run `siesta2repeat` in the directory that your calculation ran. This
  directory must contain the `.VH` and `.XV` files.
+ Three inputs need to be typed or piped in:
    + basename of the calculation i.e. for `structure.XV`, type
      `structure`
    + origin point of the grid e.g. `0.0 0.0 0.0`
    + required grid size e.g. `128 82 116`
