This is an updated C/C++ version of the REPEAT code originally written by 
Carlos Campana. Please reference:

Contents:

Source   
   This directory contains the source code, with a sample makefiles for the 
   Intel and gnu compilers.  The Gnu compiler can also be used. A README file 
   in that directory describes more details of the building process.

Examples   
   This directory contains sample input files and output files for one to check
   that their build works.

CLAPACK-3.2.1
   This is the CLAPACK linear algebra library that REPEAT uses to solve the 
   system of equations. Compiled library files built on a x86-64 Linux machine
   are included. If these don't work, then the library will have to be
   rebuilt on the user's machine.

Converters
   This contains some utility files to convert files to the CUBE file format
   that REPEAT uses to read the electrostatic potential(ESP) of the system. 
   For example, the periodic DFT code VASP stores the ESP in the LOCPOT file 
   (with the proper input settings). There is a Python script that converts
   this to a CUBE file.

bin
   This directory contains a g++ compiled version of the repeat exectuable
   that was compiled on an AMD Epyc(2nd Gen) system doesn't need any Intel 
   libraries to run.
